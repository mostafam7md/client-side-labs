# Frontend Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repo contains small tasks and experiments I worked on while learning frontend development.  
I started from the basics and gradually moved into more modern features of each technology.

## ðŸ“Œ Covered Topics

### 1. HTML â†’ HTML5
- Learned basic page structure with `html`, `head`, and `body`.
- Added semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`.
- Worked with forms, audio, and video elements introduced in HTML5.

### 2. CSS â†’ CSS3
- Styled pages with colors, fonts, and layouts.
- Used **Flexbox** and **Grid** for modern responsive design.
- Added animations, transitions, and shadows with CSS3.

### 3. JavaScript (ES5 â†’ ES6)
- Started with ES5 basics: variables, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation.
- Moved to ES6 features:
  - `let` and `const`
  - Arrow functions
  - Template literals
  - Modules and imports
  - Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build a solid foundation in frontend development by practicing and applying concepts step by step.
